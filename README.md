**_Handle Pokemons_**

An exercise practiced with API from https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?offset=0&limit=2000. Descriptions as below:

- Create data.json file from API.
- Load the json content and parse it into a readable format for PHP.
- Create an HTML element that notifies the user about how many pokemons are being displayed, this number should come from the json content, not hardcoded.
- Loop through the list of pokemons, and only display the name, and the url of each pokemons.
- Display each pokemon with an index number (0 - 1118)
- Split the array into chunks of 50 pokemons, limit the result to only show the 3rd group of 50 pokemons.
- Allow a page parameter to your PHP application, display the corresponding group of 50 pokemons according to the user query parameter. Such as localhost:5000/?page=15 should display the 15th group of 50 pokemons.
